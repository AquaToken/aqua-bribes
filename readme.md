<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Aquarius voting tool Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://vote.aqua.network/)


#### What is Aquarius bribes?
The term bribe has been used in various DeFi communities for a while to describe the practice of buying votes.

Bribes offer a way for voters to earn incentives just by voting, with no need to place funds at risk inside of AMMs or order books. Essentially, bribes offer another utility benefit to AQUA holders.

We have brought bribes native to the Aquarius protocol, allowing everyone to view voting incentives all in one place. At the same time, through a simple interface, anyone can quickly set up and distribute bribe rewards on desired markets.

#### How does it work?
Using the interface, users allocate bribes to their chosen markets by selecting a market, the size of rewards, and the time period for the bribe.

From a technical standpoint, creating a bribe initiates a new claimable balance payment. The claimable balance has two Stellar wallets as claimants. One of them is the Aquarius bribe collection address, with the second being the indicator towards which market the bribes inside the claimable balance get allocated. It is also possible to schedule bribes in advance (e.g., several weeks ahead). Such schedules are also enforced on-chain through the use of timestamp predicates.

Every week on Sunday, the Aquarius bribe collector will claim all available claimable balances for the coming week. The Aquarius bribe collection address distributes all collected bribes to voters through the following Monday-Sunday.

The flow for voting will stay mostly the same. If a user decides to vote for a market pair offering bribes, they should expect to get their share of voting rewards daily.

Multiple tokens can get assigned as bribes for a market. Since bribes get delivered through standard Stellar payments, a user can choose not to accept certain bribe tokens by not making a trustline to the token.
